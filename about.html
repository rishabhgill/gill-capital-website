      <h2>About Gill Capital</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an internationally certified business coach with extensive 
        experience in founder psychology. Over the years, I’ve seen that while 
        many advisors teach marketing, sales, operations, and finance, they 
        often overlook the most critical factor: the founder’s mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Gill Capital, we prioritize mental clarity, awareness of biases, and 
        a growth-oriented belief system to help founders transform their 
        businesses into industry leaders. Our goal is to empower startups 
        through capital investment, strategic mentorship, and a deep commitment 
        to founder psychology.

        We invest in visionary founders who recognize that personal growth and 
        business growth are inseparable. By combining capital infusion with 
        one-on-one coaching, we help founders overcome mental barriers and 
        chart a path to exponential growth.
