      <h2>Book a Pitch Session</h2>
      <p>
        Our pitch sessions focus on <strong>Problem, Solution, and Traction</strong> 
        in the first meeting. We then conduct deeper dives into each aspect of 
        your business, including psychometric tests to understand how founders 
        make decisions under pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        By booking a pitch session with Gill Capital, you’ll receive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct feedback on your business model</li>
        <li>Insights into founder mindset and areas for growth</li>
        <li>Potential for funding and long-term partnership</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We encourage you to come prepared with a concise presentation and any 
        supporting documents that highlight your product, traction, and vision. 
        Successful pitches will move on to more in-depth discussions.
